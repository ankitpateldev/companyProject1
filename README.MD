MADE BY @ANKIT PATEL AS A COMPANY DEMO PROJECT

// my first project

Aim: build only front page using bootstrap or other library and responsive to mobile devices

1. I use React Js library to build this
   beacuse im more comfortable in this.

2. npm install react-bootstrap
   I use react-bootstrap for make it responsive and nice look. most of the react-bootstrap is used in panel and navbar component to achieve the require content.
