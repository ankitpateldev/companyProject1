            Starline Exhibits International CustomTentwithLogo.com is the premier creator of high-quality banners and tents to fit the marketing needs of any company. With a track record that spans a decade, we print custom pop up tents and canopies for our clients at a reasonable cost. Built with durability in mind, our dye sublimation techniques ensure that the prints we give to our clients keep lasting well into the future. We can even offer personalized branding for your shade covers, making your brand stand out from your competitors. You need custom canopy tents on a crowded expo floor to let the audience know where you are and what you offer. We can make that happen to your specifications.

            Our in-house team will produce 3D rendered images of the artwork you upload to us to ensure that it fits the size and shape of your pop up tent or canopy. Our range of lightweight aluminum or heavy-duty steel frames (Lux50MM, Pre40MM, Std30MM) is perfect for any company's advertising or marketing budget. Thanks to consistent engineering and quality, we are proud to say that our custom printed canopies are certified and compliant. Our budget range has full certification from structural engineers and is compliant with CPAI-84, NFPA 701and California Title 19.

            We believe a company shouldn't limit itself to the things others are doing. Standing out means being unique, and to that end, we offer our clients several shapes and styles for canopies. Inflatable custom canopies, star shades, and large event tents all fall into what we offer to our clients. A proper display isn't complete with just a pop-up tent, however. You can get a variety of custom-made banners and flags that work well alongside these tents to generate interest and attract visitors to your booth. If you're interested in finding out more about what we offer, give us a call today or order online. Each tent or canopy we manufacture comes with a full warranty.
